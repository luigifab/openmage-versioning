# versioning

A module to automatize the updates using GIT for [OpenMage](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts).

For more information, go to https://www.luigifab.fr/openmage/versioning (IPv6 is required, it's not a joke). No IPv6? It's possible to get an IPv6 thanks to *Miredo*. Run `sudo apt install miredo` and `sudo service miredo force-start`.

This repository is a releases mirror. To install the module, please use the composer key available in the documentation.
